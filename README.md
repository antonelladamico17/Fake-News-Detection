# Fighting Against Infodemic: Fake News Detection in the Era of Covid-19

### Master Degree in Data Science and Economics

Ever since the first case of Covid19 appeared in Wuhan, China at the end
of December 2019, the world has been struggling not only with a pandemic
but in parallel with infodemic - i.e. excessive circulation of high-speed, worldwide,
often unverifiable news stories on a given topic that do not allow for the
identification of trustworthy sources.
Search engines, including Google, are nowadays along with print newspapers,
a reliable source where people can find information.
This study aims to identify possible fake news that may be circulating on
the Search Engine. A real dataset containing Covid19 related information in
different time frames was used. Re-sampling techniques were required due
to the strong class imbalance. Machine learning algorithms were applied for
classification. In addition to textual features, topic distribution, sentiment,
and emotion were also included, proving that the inclusion of these can improve
the performance of the classifier.
